# FlowSight AI Demo

FlowSight AI is a lightweight **workflow intelligence** tool for small teams (5–50) that helps you **see where work gets stuck**, detect bottlenecks, and balance workload — using data from tools like Jira/Trello/ClickUp.

This repository contains a **landing page demo** for FlowSight AI.

## 🚀 What problem does it solve?

Most teams ship late, but don’t know why.

Work is spread across:
- task boards (Jira/Trello/ClickUp)
- chat (Slack)
- docs/spreadsheets
- email

So delays become guesswork, and burnout happens silently.

---

## ✅ Solution

FlowSight AI connects to your task tools and automatically:
- maps real workflow steps (Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done)
- detects bottlenecks and stuck stages
- highlights workload imbalance
- predicts delivery risk based on real cycle time

All insights are explained in **plain language**, not complex charts.

---

## 🧠 How it works (simple)

1) **Connect tools** (Jira/Trello/ClickUp)  
2) **Analyze task events** (status changes, timestamps, assignees)  
3) **Generate insights** (bottlenecks, risk, suggestions)

---

## 🔥 Key features

- **Bottleneck detection** (e.g. “Review is stuck 4.8 days avg”)
- **Workload imbalance alerts** (overloaded roles / single point of failure)
- **Cycle time trends** (what’s slowing down this week)
- **Delivery risk prediction**
- **Team health signals** (interruptions, re-opened tasks, scope creep)

---

## 🎯 Use cases

- Project delay analysis
- Sprint planning & capacity forecasting
- Process optimization
- Remote team visibility (without micromanagement)

## 🧩 Demo diagram (suggested)

You can present FlowSight AI as a simple pipeline:

```text
[Jira / Trello / ClickUp]
        |
        v
[FlowSight AI Ingest]
(task events + timestamps)
        |
        v
[AI Workflow Analyzer]
(bottlenecks + workload + trends)
        |
        v
[Insights Dashboard + Alerts]
(actionable suggestions)
